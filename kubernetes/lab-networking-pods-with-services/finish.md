# Summary

In this lab, you learned how to network Pods with Services in Kubernetes. You created a simple Pod running the Nginx image, created a Service to target the Pod, and tested the Service by accessing it from another Pod. You also learned how to update the Service to target a different set of Pods and how to update the label of a Pod to match the new selector in the Service. Services are an essential component of networking in Kubernetes and allow you to connect to Pods in a reliable and scalable way.
