# Summary

To complete this challenge, you will need a Git repository with at least one commit, and a basic understanding of Git concepts like commits, branches, and the staging area.

You will follow three steps: using the `restore` command to undo changes to a file in the working directory, using the `rm` command to remove a file from the repository, and using the `reset` command to undo the most recent commit and reset the current branch to a previous commit.

By the end of the challenge, you will have a better understanding of how to manage changes and the commit history in your Git repository.
