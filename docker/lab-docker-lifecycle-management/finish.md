# Summary

In this lab, we learned the basics of Docker lifecycle management. We created a Docker image, ran a Docker container, and learned how to manage Docker containers. We also cleaned up the resources we created. Docker is a powerful tool that can simplify application deployment and increase flexibility. With Docker, you can easily package, distribute, and run applications inside containers.
