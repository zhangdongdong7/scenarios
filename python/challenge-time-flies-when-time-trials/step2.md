# What Time Is Next?

What's the date of the next 10 days, next 100 days, next 1000 days, and next 10000 days?

Try to calculate in the Python script `next_days.py`.

For example:

```bash
# if today is 2000-01-01
python next_days.py
# the script output
2000-01-11
2000-04-11
2002-09-27
2027-05-19
```

in Python console.

## Requirements

- The path of `next_days.py` is `/home/labex`, don't move it or change the filename.
- The `datetime` module should be used.
- The keyword `for` should be used.
