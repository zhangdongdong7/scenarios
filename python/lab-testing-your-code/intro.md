# Python Unittest Lab

In this lab, we will learn how to write unit tests for our Python code using the built-in unittest module. We will start with a simple function and then build up to testing more complex code, including code that interacts with databases. 


## Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, you should have a basic understanding of Python programming language. You should also have some familiarity with writing functions in Python.
